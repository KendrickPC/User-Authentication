# Cryptography

With a digital signature, we have some sort of data that we want to put our digital signature on. 

An analogy is a legal document (with data) and we wanna sign it. We wanna make sure that the receiver of the data is guaranteed that the data on the document has not been tampered with. Also, we want to verify that the intended recipient is the one who signed the document.

In Summary:
1. We need to sign the message.
2. Verify the message.
